### PROJECT OVERVIEW  

The project aims to build a hospital data warehouse to centalize, analyse and visualize data for better decision-making and operational efficiency.
KEY OBJECTIVES: 
- Database Development: Designed and implemented a relational database in SQL to store and manage six hospital datasets.
- Data Cleaning and Preparation: Used Alteryx to clean, transform and standardise data for consistency and accuracy.
- Exploratory Data Analysis EDA: Conducted SQL-based analysis to uncover trends in patient demographics, disease patterns, and hospital resource allocation.
- Visualization and Reporting : Created charts in excel  and built interactive dashboards in Power BI for data-driven insights.
- Operational Insights and Recommendations: Identified inefficiences in hospital operations and proposed data-driven solutions to improve patient care and resourse management.

### DATA SOURCES

The primary dataset used for this project is the “Data.zip” file, with six hospital csv files containing patient data.

### TOOLS

-	SQL: Created and managed the hospital data warehouse, performed queries and joined tables for analysis.
-	ALTERYX: Cleaned and transformed raw hospital datasets for accuracy and consistency.
-	POWER BI: Developed interactive dashboards and visualizations to uncover insights.
-	EXCEL: Created charts for data exploration and trend analysis.

### DATA CLEANING

1.	Standardized and formatted raw hospital data using Alteryx
2.	Removed duplicates, handled missing values and ensured data consistency.
3.	Joined and structured datasets in SQL for seamless integration.
4.	Validated data quality before analysis and visualization.

### EDA

EDA involves exploring the hospital data to answer key questions such as:
1.	How do different age groups experience specific medical conditions?
2.	Which racial group had the most encounters?
3.	How was the trend of encounters over the years?
4.	Which departments had the highest readmission rates?
5.	Which gender had the most encounters over the years?
6.	Is there a shortage of staff in critical departments?

### FINDINGS

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
-	Patient admissions or the encounter trend increased over the years.
-	Unpaid medical bills are highest among the Ethnics groups, affecting financial sustainability.
-	The most patients served at MGH are whites.
-	Specialties such as surgery, cardiology, and orthopedics often see a higher preference for female healthcare providers.
-	The most common reasons for hospital visits are chronic diseases in the middle-aged group with a higher proportion of females.
-	Medicaid is the most common insurance type among patients, Private insurance is less common.


### RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Patient management and admissions: Implement targeted health programs for high-risk age groups
2.  Expand specialized medical training for women: Offer scholarships for technical skills in surgery, cardiology and orthopedics to increase the number of female specialists in these critical fields.
3.  Support healthcare policy reforms: Advocate for Medicaid expansion to improve access to quality care for low -income individuals.
4. Financial optimization: Improve billing and payment tracking systems to reduce unpaid medical bills.
5. Readmission reduction strategies: Increase patient education and follow-up programs for high-risk conditions.
6. Use predictive analysis to anticipate patient surges and proactively manage resources.

### LIMITATIONS

-	Lack of external factors: The dataset does not account for external influences like socio-economic conditions.
-	Data privacy and compliance issues: Sensitive patient information may be anonymized or excluded, limiting analysis depth.
-	Incomplete data records: Missing or inconsistent entries may affect the accuracy of analysis and insights.
-	Static data: If the dataset is not regularly updated, it may not reflect current hospital trends and patient needs.
-	Errors in data entry: Manual data input could introduce inaccuracies that impact findings.
